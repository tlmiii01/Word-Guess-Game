# Word-Guess-Game

This is a Jimi Hendrix-themed word guessing game.  To start, load index.html into your favorite web browser and press any key to start.  As you guess letters correctly, they will populate on the game board.  The web site will also keep track of all your missed guesses.

Guess all of the letters correctly and you will get to listen to part of the song.  Make sure you have your sound up!!

This project encompasses the subjects I have learned so far in Bootcamp.  The following technologies wher incorporated into this website:

 - HTML5
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - Just a wee bit of jQuery
